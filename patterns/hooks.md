# Hooks

Hooks is the latest pattern and experimental feature that's better than sliced bread. Everyone used to go next over [Render props](/patterns/render-props.md) but now it's all hooks. 

> Hooks are an upcoming feature that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class. They’re currently in React v16.8.0-alpha.0

It's an upcoming feature, it's an alpha and still we can't wait to use it, so why is that? 

## Problems Hooks are trying to address 
-** “attach” reusable behavior to a component**, (for example, connecting it to a store)
[render props](/patterns/render-props.md) and TODO link **higher order** components try to solve these
